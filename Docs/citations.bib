Therefore, methods of ELA reconstruction employed in low-relief environments are commonly not applicable in high mountains, or require some modification. We review the concept of the ELA, with reference to the mass balance of a range of glacier types found in high-mountain regions. We examine the applicability of several commonly used methods of ELA reconstruction for different glacier types, and propose some general principles to guide the choice of appropriate methods.},

	abstract = {Sound knowledge of the ice volume and ice-thickness distribution of a glacier is essential for many glaciological applications. However, direct measurements of ice thickness are laborious, not feasible everywhere and necessarily restricted to a small number of glaciers. In this paper, we present a method to estimate the ice-thickness distribution and the total ice volume of alpine glaciers. This method is based on glacier mass turnover and principles of ice-flow mechanics. The required input data are the glacier surface topography, the glacier outline and a set of borders delineating different ‘ice-flow catchments’. Three parameters describe the distribution of the ‘apparent mass balance’, which is defined as the difference between the glacier surface mass balance and the rate of ice-thickness change, and two parameters define the ice-flow dynamics. The method was developed and validated on four alpine glaciers located in Switzerland, for which the bedrock topography is partially known from radio-echo soundings. The ice thickness along 82 cross-profiles can be reproduced with an average deviation of about 25\% between the calculated and the measured ice thickness. The cross-sectional areas differ by less than 20\% on average. This shows the potential of the method for estimating the ice-thickness distribution of alpine glaciers without the use of direct measurements.},

For past and potential climate scenarios, glacier changes for assumed mass-balance changes are calculated as step functions between steady-state conditions for time intervals that approximately correspond to the characteristic dynamic response time (a few decades) of the glaciers. In order to test the procedure, a pilot study was carried out in the European Alps where detailed glacier inventories had been compiled around the mid-1970s. Total glacier volume in the Alps is estimated at about 130 km3 for the mid-1970s; strongly negative mass balances are likely to have caused a loss of about 10–20\% of this total volume during the decade 1980–90. Backward calculation of glacier-length changes using a mean annual mass balance of 0.25m w.e.a−1 since the end of the “Little Ice Age” around 1850 AD gives considerable scatter but satisfactory overall results as compared with long-term observations. The total loss of Alpine surface ice mass since 1850 can be estimated at about half the original value. An acceleration of this development, with annual mass losses of around 1 m a−1 or more as anticipated from IPCC scenario A for the coming century, could eliminate major parts of the presently existing Alpine ice volume within decades.},

Before uncertainty assessment, the model was tuned to observed mass balance for the investigated time period and its robustness was tested by comparing observed and modelled mass balance over 11 years, yielding very small deviations. Both systematic and random uncertainties are assigned to twelve input parameters and their respective values estimated from the literature or from available meteorological data sets. The calculated overall uncertainty in the model output is dominated by systematic errors and amounts to 0.7 m w.e. or approximately 10\% of total melt over the investigated time span. In order to provide a first order estimate on variability in uncertainty depending on the quality of input data, we conducted a further experiment, calculating overall uncertainty for different levels of uncertainty in measured global radiation and air temperature. Our results show that the output of a well calibrated model is subject to considerable uncertainties, in particular when applied for extrapolation in time and space where systematic errors are likely to be an important issue.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Past deglacial ice sheet reconstructions have generally relied upon discipline-specific constraints with no attention given to the determination of objective confidence intervals. Reconstructions based on geophysical inversion of relative sea level (RSL) data have the advantage of large sets of proxy data but lack ice-mechanical constraints. Conversely, reconstructions based on dynamical ice sheet models are glaciologically self-consistent, but depend on poorly constrained climate forcings and sub-glacial processes. As an example of a much better constrained methodology that computes explicit error bars, we present a distribution of high-resolution glaciologically-self-consistent deglacial histories for the North American ice complex calibrated against a large set of RSL, marine limit, and geodetic data. The history is derived from ensemble-based analyses using the 3D MUN glacial systems model and a high-resolution ice-margin chronology derived from geological and geomorphological observations. Isostatic response is computed with the VM5a viscosity structure. Bayesian calibration of the model is carried out using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in combination with artificial neural networks trained to the model results. The calibration provides a posterior distribution for model parameters (and thereby modeled glacial histories) given the observational data sets that takes data uncertainty into account. Final ensemble results also account for fits between computed and observed strandlines and marine limits. Given the model (including choice of calibration parameters), input and constraint data sets, and VM5a earth rheology, we find the North American contribution to mwp1a was likely between 9.4 and 13.2m eustatic over a 500year interval. This is more than half of the total 16 to 26m meltwater pulse over 500 to 700years (with lower values being more probable) indicated by the Barbados coral record (Fairbanks, 1989, Peltier and Fairbanks, 2006) if one assumes a 5meter living range for the Acropora Palmata coral. 20ka ice volume for North America was likely 70.1±2.0m eustatic, or about 60\% of the total contribution to eustatic sea level change. We suspect that the potentially most critical unquantified uncertainties in our analyses are those related to model structure (especially climate forcing), deglacial ice margin chronology, and earth rheology.},

	abstract = {Glaciers are among the key indicators of ongoing climate change. The equilibrium line altitude is a theoretical line which defines the altitude at which annual accumulation equals the ablation. It represents the lowest boundary of the climatic glacierisation and, therefore, is an excellent proxy for climate variability. In this study we introduce a simple approach for modelling the glacier distribution at high spatial resolution over entire mountain ranges using a minimum of input data. An empirical relationship between precipitation and temperature at the steady-state equilibrium line altitude (ELA0), is derived from direct glaciological mass balance measurements. Using geographical information systems (GIS) and a digital elevation model, this relationship is then applied over a spatial domain, to a so-called distributed modelling of the regional climatic ELA0 (rcELA0) and the climatic accumulation area (cAA) of 1971–1990 over the entire European Alps. A sensitivity study shows that a change in rcELA0 of ±100 m is caused by a temperature change of ±1 °C or a precipitation decrease of 20\% and increase of 27\%, respectively. The modelled cAA of 1971–1990 agrees well with glacier outlines from the 1973 Swiss Glacier Inventory. Assuming a warming of 0.6 °C between 1850 and 1971–1990 leads to a mean rcELA0 rise of 75 m and a corresponding cAA reduction of 26\%. A further rise in temperature of 3 °C accompanied by an increase in precipitation of 10\% leads to a further mean rise of the rcELA0 of about 340 m and reduces the cAA of 1971–1990 by 74\%.},

	abstract = {The rapid rate of global warming currently underway highlights the need for a deeper understanding of abrupt climate change. The Younger Dryas is a Late-Glacial climate event of widespread and unusually rapid change whose study can help us address this need for increased understanding. Reconstructions from the glacial record offer important contributions to our understanding of the Younger Dryas due to (among other things) the direct physical response of glaciers to even minor perturbations in climate. Because the glacier equilibrium line altitude (ELA) provides a more explicit comparison of climate than properties such as glacier length or area, ELA methods lend themselves well to paleoclimate applications and allow for more direct comparisons in space and time. Here we present a physically based ELA model for alpine paleoglacier climate reconstructions that accounts for differences in glacier width, glacier shape, bed topography and ice thickness, and includes error estimates using Monte Carlo simulations. We validate the ELA model with published mass balance measurements from 4 modern glaciers in the Swiss Alps. We then use the ELA model, combined with a temperature index model, to estimate the changes in temperature and precipitation between the Younger Dryas (constrained by 10Be surface exposure ages) and the present day for three glacier systems in the Graubünden Alps. Our results indicate an ELA depression in this area of 320 m ±51 m during the Younger Dryas relative to today. This ELA depression represents annual mean temperatures 2.29 °C ±1.32 °C cooler relative to today in the region, which corresponds to a decrease in mean summer temperatures of 1.47 °C ±0.73 °C. Our results indicate relatively small changes in summer temperature dominate over other climate changes for the Younger Dryas paleoglaciers in the Alps. This ELA-based paleoclimate reconstruction offers a simple, fast, and cost-effective alternative to many other paleoclimate reconstruction methods. Continued application of the ELA model to more regions will lead to an improved understanding of the Younger Dryas in the Alps, and by extension, of rapid climate events generally.},

Several topographic attributes, such as elevation (above mean sea level), relative relief, slope, aspect, curvature, slope-length and -steepness (LS) factor, terrain ruggedness index (TRI), topographic wetness index (TWI), hypsometric integral (Ihyp) and drainage network attributes (stream number and stream length) of two tropical mountain river basins, viz., Muthirapuzha River Basin and Pambar River Basin are compared to evaluate the variations. Though the basins are comparable in extent, they differ in respect of terrain characteristics and climate. The results suggest that ASTER and SRTM provide equally reliable representation of topography portrayed by TOPO and the topographic attributes extracted from the spaceborne DEMs are in agreement with those derived from TOPO. Despite the coarser resolution, SRTM shows relatively higher vertical accuracy (RMSE = 23 and 20 m respectively in MRB and PRB) compared to ASTER (RMSE = 33 and 24 m) and GMTED (RMSE = 59 and 48 m). Vertical accuracy of all the spaceborne DEMs is influenced by relief of the terrain as well as type of vegetation. Further, GMTED shows significant deviation for most of the attributes, indicating its inability for mountain-river-basin-scale studies.},
